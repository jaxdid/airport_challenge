Description
-----------
This project aims to create a basic airport and air traffic control management software. It is intended to provide the following core functionality:

* Planes should be able to land at an airport and confirm they have landed
* Planes should be able to take off from an airport and confirm they are no longer in the airport
* Prevent planes landing and take-off during stormy weather
* Prevent planes landing at "full" airports
* Set a default capacity for airports that can be overridden as needed

Instructions
------------
* Run the program by loading or requiring 'lib/airport.rb' in any REPL environment that supports Ruby (e.g., irb)
* Run Rspec tests by entering the `rspec` command in your command line interface.
